## Post-Mortem
I had a lot of fun making this game and as it being my first ever, ShadowDyne Inc will always have a special place in my heart. I hope to one day return to this game to flesh it out and create a more working final product.
<br/><br/>

### <ins>What I Gained – JavaScript Classes:</ins>
JavaScript Classes is something that as a Web Developer, I never really get any reason to use them. Functional Programming is always the go too. Seeing as it was many years since the last time I used them, this really gave me an ample opportunity to dust those cobwebs off. Inheritance was something that I struggled with fondly throughout the development and has now given me a better understanding of how to properly organize my files and Classes.
<br/><br/>

### <ins>What I Gained – JSON:</ins>
One of the constraints I put onto myself was to use JSON as a means of storing data for the Player Object. I chose JSON because it is a file system that can be constantly changed and is low in space. Since the changes would be small in scale, the speed of the change didn’t really matter much. Implementation wise, I never got around to adding any JSON. This was a feature I had to cut in order to be able to turn something in before the time was up. I found myself struggling to understand how the engine stored data. I opted to use JavaScript Objects instead. The engine was designed around this and with the clock ticking down, this was not a battle I wanted to fight.
<br/><br/>

### <ins>What I Gained – Engine Choice:</ins>
I chose Phaser.JS because I wanted to have more practice with vanilla JavaScript. At the time, I had been working on nothing but React and NextJS projects. Using plain vanilla JavaScript felt like meeting an old friend. Phaser.JS was built with JavaScript in mind and worked fantastically on the browser. This engine is the most used JavaScript game engine out there as of writing this. This translates to engine development and lots of developer support. The constraint by the GameJam was that the final product had to work on the browser. This engine seemed perfect for the task.
<br/><br/>
With that all being said, I do not plan on using this engine again. I found the documentation to be wholly lacking. The support aspect was also practically nonexistent. These were issues that I have delt with plenty and ultimately end up using a tool or frameworks raw code to figure how something works. The deciding factor was the business model. The Editor and several other features were locked behind a yearly subscription. As this was just a one off thing, I struggled to justify the cost. It just didn’t sit right with me as the lack of an Editor and paywalled tutorials were very hindering in understanding the engine.
<br/><br/>
I have now moved on to the Godot Engine. Pain points that I had with the Phaser engine were simple remedies with Godot. Seeing as Godot is rising in popularity, that seems like the engine of choice moving forward for any consecutive GameJams. I hope to return to this game at some point but using Godot as the engine of choice. I already created the assets for it so I would hate to have them go to waste.
